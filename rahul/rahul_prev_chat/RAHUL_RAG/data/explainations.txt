1. The system measures all electrical values in real time
– Solar/wind generation
– Battery voltage & current
– Grid input condition
– Inverter input/output
– Load consumption of all three zones


2. Sensors collect accurate data
– PZEM modules measure voltage, current, power factor
– CT sensors measure zone-wise current
– Shunt & voltage divider measure battery parameters


3. The controller analyzes the collected data
– Checks how much power is available
– Compares available power with the demand of each zone
– Identifies low generation or overload conditions


4. The system decides which loads should remain ON
– Critical loads get the highest priority
– Sub-critical and non-critical loads operate only if extra power is available
– Prevents overload and protects equipment


5. The system automatically controls relays
– Turns ON/OFF zones based on priority
– Manages battery charging
– Switches between solar, battery, and grid as needed


6. The inverter and grid logic operate automatically
– Grid power is used when available
– Inverter supplies power during grid failure
– System prevents reverse power and low-voltage issues


7. The controller updates the dashboard continuously
– Shows active zones
– Displays power generation and consumption
– Indicates grid, battery, and inverter status


8. Alerts are generated when needed
– Low power
– Overload
– Low battery
– Zone OFF/ON notifications


9. All actions happen automatically
– No manual switching required
– Ensures stable, safe, and uninterrupted operation
