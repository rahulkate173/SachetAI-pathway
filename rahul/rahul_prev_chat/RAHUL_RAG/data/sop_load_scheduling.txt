1. Title
    Load Scheduling & Shedding SOP
2. Purpose
    Define how loads turn ON/OFF based on classification.
3. Scope
    Applies to critical, sub-critical, and non-critical loads.
4. Load Categories
    •	Critical: Hospitals, pumps, essential services
    •	Sub-Critical: Street lights, public utilities
    •	Non-Critical: AC, heaters, EV charging, etc.

5. Procedure by Case
    Case 1 – High Generation
        •	All loads ON
        •	Schedule next check in 15 minutes
    Case 2 – Medium Generation
        •	Turn OFF non-critical
        •	Reduce sub-critical duty cycle by 30%
        •	Maintain critical ON
    Case 3 – Low Generation
        •	Only critical ON
        •	Sub-critical OFF
        •	Non-critical OFF
        •	Alert user: “Low generation condition.”
    Case 4 – Very Low Generation
        •	Activate emergency mode
        •	Turn OFF all loads except life-support
        •	Alarm → “Grid emergency.”

6. Exception Handling
    •	If sudden spike in IG → immediate load shedding
    •	If VG drops below 180V for 5 mins → emergency mode
7. Logs
    Schedule state stored in DB.
