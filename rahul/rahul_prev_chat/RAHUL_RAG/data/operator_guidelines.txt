Operator Guidelines (User Manual)

These guidelines help the operator use the microgrid monitoring and control system safely, efficiently, and without damaging any connected equipment.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Before Starting the System

    1. Ensure all wiring connections are properly tightened and insulated.

    2. Check that the solar panels, battery, and inverter connections are correctly installed.

    3. Confirm that the grid power input (if available) is stable.

    4. Verify that all sensors (PZEM, CT, shunt) are correctly placed and reading values.

    5. Make sure the load zones are connected according to their priority (Critical, Sub-Critical, Non-Critical).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Normal Operation

    1. Turn ON the main system power supply.

    2. Observe the dashboard to confirm:
    Solar generation (WG)
    Battery voltage and SOC
    Grid availability
    Load zone status (ON/OFF)

    3. Allow the system to automatically manage loads—no manual switching is needed.

    4. Always keep Critical loads connected only in Zone 1.

    5. Avoid connecting high-power appliances in Zone 2 and Zone 3 during low generation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. During High Solar Power

    1. Operate all three zones normally.
    2. Use high-power appliances (motors, pumps, EV chargers) during this period.
    3. Allow the battery to charge full.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. During Medium Solar Power

    1. Use only essential and medium-priority loads.
    2. Avoid turning ON unnecessary appliances in Zone 3.
    3. Check that battery charging is not interrupted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. During Low Solar Power

    1. Switch OFF non-essential appliances manually, if required.
    2. Keep only critical loads running.
    3. Do not operate motors, irons, heaters, or EV chargers.
    4. Monitor battery voltage closely.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. During Very Low Power or Cloudy Weather

    1. Reduce load usage immediately.
    2. Keep only emergency loads running.
    3. Follow system alerts strictly (Low Power / Low Battery).
    4. Allow the battery to recover without heavy load.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. During Grid Outage

    1. Do not operate heavy or inductive loads.
    2. Let the inverter and battery handle only essential loads.
    3. Avoid frequent switching ON/OFF of devices.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Safety Guidelines

    1. Never bypass relays or protection circuits.
    2. Do not tamper with sensor wiring.
    3. Keep the system enclosure dry and dust-free.
    4. Disconnect power before performing any maintenance.
    5. Only qualified technical staff should handle repairs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Dashboard / Display Usage

    1. Check zone status indicators (ON/OFF).
    2. Monitor real-time power readings.
    3. Respond to warning/alert messages immediately.
    4. Do not ignore low battery or overload notifications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Communication & Alerts

    1. GSM/LTE alerts must be enabled for remote monitoring.
    2. Ensure the SIM card has valid network coverage.
    3. Respond quickly to overload, low battery, or grid failure alerts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Recommended Best Practices
    1. Plan high-power work during peak sunlight hours.
    2. Keep zone loads within their rated capacity.
    3. Periodically check sensor readings for abnormalities.
    4. Maintain battery health by avoiding deep discharge.
