CASE 1 – HIGH GENERATION
Condition: WG > WC + WS + WN
Action: All zones ON (Critical, Sub-Critical, Non-Critical)
Voltage: 210–240 V
Current: 50–70% rated
PF: 0.85–1.0
Meaning: Stable grid, enough power for all loads.
-------------------------------------------------------
CASE 2 – MEDIUM GENERATION
Condition: WG > WC + WS
Action: Critical + Sub-Critical ON, Non-Critical OFF
Voltage: 200–230 V
Current: 60–85%
PF: 0.80–0.95
Meaning: System can handle essential + moderate loads.
-----------------------------------------------
CASE 3 – LOW GENERATION
Condition: WG > WC
Action: Only Critical zone ON
Voltage: 190–210 V
Current: 70–95%
PF: 0.75–0.90
Meaning: Grid stressed, keep only critical loads running.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 4 – VERY LOW GENERATION
Condition: WG < WC
Action: Emergency Mode — only life-support loads ON
Voltage: < 190 V
Current: > 90%
PF < 0.75
Meaning: Generation insufficient; emergency cut-off triggered.
