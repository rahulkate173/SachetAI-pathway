# *DISTRIBUTED RULES, DEFINITIONS, LOAD-SHEDDING LOGIC & OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *1. Category: Definitions & Rules*

### *Critical Loads (WC)*
Critical loads must remain powered at all times except in absolute emergencies.
Examples include hospitals, life-support equipment, emergency services, drinking-water pumps, SCADA/telemetry systems, critical lighting, and sewer pumps.
They have the highest priority, and power allocation always begins with Critical loads.

### *Sub-Critical Loads (WS)*
Sub-Critical loads can tolerate short interruptions but must be restored quickly.
Examples include schools (daytime), offices, municipal buildings, small businesses.
They have mid-priority and follow business-hour scheduling rules. Curtailment is allowed but must be controlled.

### *Non-Critical Loads (WN)*
Non-Critical loads are lowest priority and are the first to be shed.
Examples include residential air-conditioning, water heaters, EV chargers, decorative lighting.
They can be curtailed for longer durations as they primarily affect comfort, not safety.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *2. Load-Shedding Rules*

Load shedding follows a strict priority sequence:

*Non-Critical → Sub-Critical → Critical*
Shedding is triggered when real power generation (WG) falls below required consumption.
* If WG < WC + WS + WN → shed Non-Critical
* If WG < WC + WS → shed Sub-Critical
* If WG < WC → emergency mode; only life-support loads stay ON

This is aligned with the four Generation Cases described below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *3. Generation Cases (Mapped to Zones and Operating Conditions)*

### *Case 1 — High Generation (WG > WC + WS + WN)*
→ *All zones ON (Critical + Sub-Critical + Non-Critical)*
*Parameter Conditions:*

* Voltage (VG): 210–240 V
* Current (IG): 50–70% rated
* Power Factor (PFG): 0.85–1.0
* Real Power (WG): > total load (e.g., >20 kW)
* Energy/day (kWhG): Normal (200–400 kWh/day)
* Frequency (FreqG): 49.5–50.5 Hz

*Meaning:* Grid is stable. All loads safely powered. No shedding.
Restore all zones and allow normal schedules.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *Case 2 — Medium Generation (WG > WC + WS)*
→ *Critical + Sub-Critical ON; Non-Critical OFF*
*Parameter Conditions:*

* VG: 200–230 V
* IG: 60–85% rated
* PFG: 0.80–0.95
* WG: Enough for Critical + Sub-Critical (15–20 kW)
* kWhG: Moderate (250–430 kWh/day)
* FreqG: 49–50.5 Hz

*Meaning:* Non-Critical loads must be shed.
Sub-Critical loads may continue but must be monitored.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *Case 3 — Low Generation (WG > WC)*
→ *Only Critical ON; Sub-Critical + Non-Critical OFF*
*Parameter Conditions:*

* VG: 190–210 V
* IG: 70–95% rated
* PFG: 0.75–0.90
* WG: Bare minimum (10–15 kW)
* kWhG: High consumption (350–450 kWh/day)
* FreqG: 49–49.7 Hz

*Meaning:* Grid is stressed.
Only essential Critical loads can remain ON.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *Case 4 — Very Low Generation (WG < WC)*
→ *Emergency Mode — Only life-support Critical loads ON*
*Parameter Conditions:*

* VG: <190 V
* IG: >90–100% rated
* PFG: <0.75
* WG: <10 kW
* kWhG: Very high (>450 kWh/day)
* FreqG: <49 Hz or >51 Hz

*Meaning:* Even Critical loads cannot be fully supported.
Disconnect everything except life-support infrastructure.
Issue emergency alerts and escalate to operators.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *4. Threshold Rules & Alerts*

### *Voltage (VG)*

* 210–240 V → Normal
* 200–210 V → Warning
* <190–200 V → Critical (shedding required)
* <185 V → Emergency

### *Current (IG)*

* <70% rated → Normal
* 70–90% rated → Warning
* > 90–100% rated → Critical

### *Power Factor (PFG)*

* ≥0.85 → Normal
* 0.80–0.85 → Warning
* <0.80 → Critical (heavy reactive load causing instability)

### *Frequency (FreqG)*

* 49.5–50.5 Hz → Stable
* 49–49.5 Hz → Warning
* <49 Hz or >51 Hz → Unstable / Emergency

### *Alert Structure*

Each alert must include:
timestamp, measured parameter, affected zones, severity (Info/Warning/Critical), recommended automatic or operator action.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *5. Scheduling Rules*

1. *Critical loads* receive power 24/7, no interruption except emergency.
2. *Sub-Critical loads* run on scheduled windows based on available surplus WG.
3. *Non-Critical loads* operate only when WG is high (Case 1).
4. *Staggered restoration* to prevent inrush currents.
5. *Time-of-day scheduling:*

   * Peak hours: shed WN, limit WS
   * Off-peak: restore WS and WN if WG allows
6. *Predictive scheduling:*

   * If forecasted WG drop occurs → shed early
   * Use historical patterns to allocate loads efficiently

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *6. Priority Policies*

### *Priority Ranking*

1. Life-safety Critical (ICU, life-support)
2. Emergency infrastructure (water supply, traffic lights)
3. Operational Critical (police comms, shelters)
4. High-priority Sub-Critical (schools during active hours)
5. Lower-priority Sub-Critical (offices, small businesses)
6. Non-Critical (residential HVAC, EV chargers)

Policies ensure that shedding follows this order and restoration is reversed in order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *7. Shedding Simulation & Timeline*

### *Stage 0 — Normal (Case 1)*
All loads ON.

### *Stage 1 — Warning*
VG dips, WG trending downward. Notify users. Reduce flexible loads.

### *Stage 2 — Non-Critical Shed (Case 2)*
WN disconnected. WS continues.

### *Stage 3 — Sub-Critical Shed (Case 3)*
Only Critical loads remain.

### *Stage 4 — Emergency (Case 4)*
Only life-support loads ON.
Trigger operator escalation and activate backup systems.

Restoration is done slowly and staggered to avoid inrush.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *8. Redundancy Checks & Hardening*

* Ensure UPS/generators for Critical loads have sufficient runtime.
* Validate SCADA telemetry is operational.
* Log every shedding/restoration event.
* Run periodic drills for Case 3 & 4 scenarios.
* Maintain manual override procedures & responsible personnel list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *9. Real-Time Dashboard Requirements*

A complete dashboard must show:

* Real-time VG, IG, PFG, WG, FreqG, kWhG
* Zone status (Critical/Sub-Critical/Non-Critical) with color-coded indicators
* Total demand vs WG surplus/deficit
* Alerts (Warning / Critical / Emergency)
* Historical graphs (24 hr–30 days)
* Auto-generated recommendations based on trends

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *10. Monitoring Queries (Your JSON Set Mapped to System Behavior)*

### *Real-time monitoring*

* query_001 Critical Load Monitoring
* query_007 Voltage & Current Risk
* query_021 Critical Alerts
* query_022 Sub-Critical Alerts
* query_023 Non-Critical Forecast Alerts

### *Scheduling & Optimization*

* query_019 Load Scheduling Optimization
* query_027 Critical Load Allocation
* query_028 Sub-Critical Allocation
* query_029 Non-Critical Allocation

### *Predictive & Simulation*

* query_006 Predictive Load Management (24-hour forecasting)
* query_017 Sudden WG Drop Simulation
* query_018 Sudden WN Increase Simulation

### *Historical Analysis*

* query_005 Historical Shedding Statistics
* query_020 Historical Electrical Trends
* query_030 Shedding Efficiency Analysis
* query_031–033 Predictive Forecasts for all zones

### *Executive Reports*

* query_008 Executive Load Optimization Report

All queries interact with the same system but provide different layers of insight—real-time, predictive, historical, and optimization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *11. Total Load vs Generation Analysis*

Total demand = *WC + WS + WN*
Compare against WG:

* If WG > total → Case 1
* If WG > WC + WS → Case 2
* If WG > WC → Case 3
* If WG < WC → Case 4 (emergency)

This formula determines which zones stay ON and which are shed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *12. Quick Operator Checklist*

1. Read VG, IG, PFG, WG, kWhG, FreqG.
2. Calculate WC + WS + WN.
3. Compare WG with demand:

   * WG ≥ WC+WS+WN → All ON
   * WG ≥ WC+WS → Shed Non-Critical
   * WG ≥ WC → Shed Sub-Critical
   * WG < WC → Emergency shedding
4. Execute recommended alerts and log events.
